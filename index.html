<p id="content">First and formeost, I am a single father to a wonderful little boy. I raise him by myself, but manage to find time for work, school, friends and myself. I am an anomaly, and I am actually very proud of that. The same something that has given me a "negative" image with others is also the same something that gives me purpose everyday of my life. I find that beautifully ironic. As far as personal interesests, I played sports for the majority of my life. As much as I loved football, it landed me a lifelong neck injury that will only get worse with time, and I may need surgery eventually. Don't feel bad for me, because I dont. ;) On the other hand, I have always had a passion for anything of an artistic nature. Music specifically is my favorite, but I respect all forms of art; from films, to poetry, to paintings, to even video games. I think these things showcase the positive side of our human nature, and speak to the side of us that wants to bring order to chaos, and love to hate. In the future, my overall goal is to work for myself. I will own my own business one day. Until then I need to gain the skills to do so. That Journey started last week.</p>
